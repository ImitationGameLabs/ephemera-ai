# EPHA-Agent Core Architecture

## Overview

EPHA-Agent implements **truly autonomous AI agents** that operate in infinite loops by default, unlike traditional reactive agents that wait for user input.

## Key Innovation: Infinite Loop Architecture

### Traditional vs EPHA Approach

**Traditional Agents**:
```
User Input → Process → Response → Stop
```

**EPHA Agents**:
```
Infinite Loop:
Perception → Cognition → Action → Reflection → Repeat
(Seamlessly integrates inputs as events)
```

### Dynamic Phase System Architecture

EPHA agents use dynamic, pluggable phase systems:
```rust
// Dynamic - highly flexible
pub trait Phase: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    async fn execute(&mut self, context: &mut PhaseContext) -> PhaseResult;
    async fn on_error(&mut self, error: &PhaseError) -> PhaseErrorAction;
}

struct DynamicAgentLoop {
    phases: Vec<Box<dyn Phase>>,  // Dynamic phase collection
    execution_order: Vec<String>, // Configurable execution order
}
```

### Core Phase Types

1. **Perception**: Environmental monitoring and event processing
2. **Cognition**: Goal evaluation, decision making, learning
3. **Action**: Tool execution, communication, environmental interaction
4. **Reflection**: Outcome assessment, strategy adjustment, learning consolidation
5. **Maintenance**: Resource management, health monitoring, memory optimization

### Extensibility Features

- **Custom Phases**: Easy addition of new phase types
- **Dynamic Ordering**: Runtime phase sequence configuration
- **Conditional Execution**: Phases can execute based on conditions
- **Phase Dependencies**: Define execution dependencies between phases
- **Plugin Architecture**: Hot-swappable phase implementations

## Core Architecture

### 1. Agent State System

```
Agent State
├─ Identity (persistent): ID, personality, beliefs
├─ Cognitive (volatile): goals, working memory, attention
├─ Emotional (semi-persistent): motivation, satisfaction
└─ Physiological (dynamic): energy, load, health
```

### 2. Event-Driven Communication

**Non-blocking Event Channels**:
- Critical: System alerts, security threats
- Priority: User messages, collaboration requests
- Normal: Environmental updates, routine events

**Key Properties**:
- Events are queued without interrupting agent loops
- Back-pressure control
- Intelligent routing and filtering

### 3. Decision Making & Goal Management

**Autonomous Goal Generation**:
- Intrinsic: Learning, exploration, mastery
- Extrinsic: Response to environmental events
- Meta-goals: Efficiency, growth, well-being

**Multi-Criteria Decisions**:
- Utility evaluation, risk assessment
- Resource analysis, ethical considerations
- Bounded rationality with satisficing

## Technical Implementation

### Concurrency Model

- **Actor-based**: Each agent runs independently with private state
- **Hybrid execution**: Dedicated threads for high-load agents, async tasks for standard agents
- **Deadlock-free coordination**: Hierarchical locking protocol

### Rate Limiting & Control

**Window-based Rate Control**:
- Agents are limited to `N` loops per `X` seconds window
- Simple loops execute quickly, complex loops naturally consume more time
- Dynamic adjustment of rate limits via control API
- Automatic back-pressure during system overload

**Dynamic Configuration**:
- Runtime rate limit adjustment without agent restart
- Pause/resume agent execution capabilities
- Resource allocation tuning based on system load
- Behavioral parameter modification

### Observability & Monitoring

**Comprehensive Metrics Collection**:
- LLM request tracking per phase and total
- Phase timing and performance analysis
- Resource usage monitoring
- Error tracking and success rates

**Real-time Control Interface**:
- Dynamic rate limit configuration
- Agent state inspection and modification
- Performance metrics querying
- Live debugging capabilities

### State Management

- **Hierarchical state**: Organized by persistence and volatility
- **Optimistic concurrency**: Version vectors, conflict resolution
- **Multi-tier persistence**: Hot (memory), warm (SSD), cold (object storage)
- **Recovery**: Checkpointing, incremental saves, cross-session restoration

## Security & Safety

### Behavioral Controls
- Ethical constraint frameworks
- Real-time behavior monitoring
- Anomaly detection systems
- Resource abuse prevention

### Isolation & Security
- Process-level sandboxing
- Network segmentation
- End-to-end encryption
- Rate limiting and quotas

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Core agent loop
- Basic event system
- Simple state management

### Phase 2: Communication
- Async I/O system
- Event routing
- Multi-agent coordination

### Phase 3: Intelligence
- Advanced decision making
- Learning mechanisms
- Personality development

### Phase 5: Security
- Security frameworks
- Behavioral constraints
- Resource protection

## Key Differentiators

1. **True Autonomy**: Infinite loop operation vs reactive behavior
2. **Environmental Immersion**: Continuous awareness vs task isolation
3. **Seamless Integration**: Non-blocking I/O vs interrupt-driven
4. **Emergent Intelligence**: Simple loops → complex behaviors
5. **Dynamic Phase Architecture**: Pluggable cognitive stages vs hardcoded loops
6. **Scalable Concurrency**: Actor-based coordination

## Dynamic Phase System

### Architecture Overview

**Traditional Fixed Loop**:
- Hardcoded phase sequence

- Difficult to extend or modify
- One-size-fits-all approach

**EPHA Dynamic Phase System**:
- Pluggable phase architecture using trait system
- Configurable execution order and dependencies
- Easy addition of custom phases
- Domain-specific agent configurations
