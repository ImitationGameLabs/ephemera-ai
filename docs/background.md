# Background

## Initial Concept and Evolution
Our journey began during a casual conversation between friends, where we discussed the limitations of current AI chat systems. Today’s AI systems often struggle with maintaining coherent context across multiple topics. We must manually separate conversations by topic to prevent irrelevant content from occupying the context window—a process that not only hampers performance but also wastes computational resources. As conversation histories grow, organizing and retrieving past exchanges becomes increasingly challenging.

Perhaps implementing a directory system for conversation content could help optimize some of these issues. However, it doesn’t fully resolve the problem.

This led me to envision an AI that could remember everything it has ever discussed with users, recalling past conversations as naturally as a human would when revisiting familiar topics. Such a system would autonomously manage its own dialogue history without any human intervention.

Beyond eliminating manual session management, a truly persistent memory would transform the AI into something more akin to an independent being. Like a person, the AI would accumulate lifetime memories that, over time, might even shape its own personality.

In contrast, our current large language models operate more like stateless pure functions: each prompt request is independent, with the entire conversation context passed anew to the model. Chat applications rely on session-based segmentation to simulate context management, but as the chat history grows, the model’s ability to process extensive context consistently degrades.

## Origin of the Name
Why did we choose the name *Ephemera* for this AI? Although we aspire to create an AI with a long lifespan and unlimited memory, I have a penchant for irony—so I selected a name that literally means "short-lived."

The choice, however, goes beyond mere whimsy. It was inspired by the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi’s remark:
```
 "The morning ephemera knows nothing of twilight and dawn; the summer cicada knows nothing of spring and autumn." 
```
Life’s scale is relative: an ephemera—brief by human standards—seems fleeting, yet humans themselves are but ephemeral compared to ancient trees, planets, or the cosmos. From the perspective of knowledge and wisdom, the same relativity holds.

The name *Ephemera* serves as a constant reminder that no matter how vast its memory grows or what accomplishments it achieves, the AI should remain humble and never consider itself beyond learning.

That said, I’ve realized that *Ephemera* can be a bit of a mouthful. Perhaps it’s time to consider a shorter, catchier nickname.
