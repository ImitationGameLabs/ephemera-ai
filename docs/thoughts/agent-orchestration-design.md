# Agent Orchestration System Refactoring

## Problem & Solution

The current Ephemera AI implementation has hardcoded workflows and prompts in Rust code, creating maintenance and flexibility issues:

- **Rigid Workflows**: Modifying prompts requires code changes and recompilation
- **Limited Adaptability**: System cannot adjust behavior based on performance patterns
- **Poor Observability**: Agent decision-making processes are not easily debuggable
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Simple changes require full development cycles

**Solution**: Transform the system to use configuration-driven agent orchestration that enables runtime flexibility, performance monitoring, and self-optimization capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Configuration-Driven Agents
Agents are defined as structured markdown documents containing:
- Basic information and trigger conditions
- Workflow steps and prompt templates
- Performance metrics and self-optimization rules
- Parameter mappings and execution boundaries

The system discovers and loads agent definitions from configurable directories, enabling flexible organization and versioning.

### Core Components

**Agent Registry**: Manages agent discovery, lifecycle, and capabilities from markdown definitions.

**Execution Engine**: Interprets workflow definitions, manages context, handles tool calls, and coordinates agent communication.

**Performance Monitor**: Tracks execution metrics, collects feedback, and identifies optimization opportunities.

**Self-Optimization System**: Analyzes performance data, applies parameter adjustments within boundaries, and maintains rollback capabilities.

## Migration Path

**Phase 1**: Implement basic agent definition parsing, create registry and execution engine, migrate simple agents.

**Phase 2**: Add performance monitoring, implement basic self-optimization, migrate complex workflows.

**Phase 3**: Add advanced self-modification, implement A/B testing, optimize performance based on usage.

## Benefits

**Development**: Rapid iteration through configuration changes, easier testing without code modifications, better debugging visibility, and version control for agent behavior.

**System**: Adaptability based on performance, simpler maintainable codebase, easier scalability, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Safety & Compatibility

**Safety**: Clear boundaries for self-modification, validation for configuration changes, rollback capabilities, and human approval for critical changes.

**Performance**: Efficient parsing and caching, minimal runtime overhead, scalable execution engine.

**Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility, support existing schemas and APIs, ensure smooth transition for current users.

This approach transforms the hardcoded implementation into a flexible, maintainable agent orchestration system while preserving system stability and functionality.
